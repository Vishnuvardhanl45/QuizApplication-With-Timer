# QuizApplication-With-Timer

Project Name: Quiz Application (with Timer)

Programming Language: Java

Description: This is a simple Java console-based quiz application that allows users to answer a series of multiple-choice questions within a time limit. The application calculates the user's score based on their answers and displays the final score at the end of the quiz.

Code Structure:

Question: A class representing a single question with its text, options, and the index of the correct answer.
Quiz: A class representing the entire quiz with a list of questions. It provides methods to get a question by index and to get the total number of questions.
QuizApplication: The main application class that runs the quiz. It creates a quiz instance, sets up the timer, and handles user input.
TimerHelper: A utility class that helps with timer-related tasks, such as starting and canceling the timer, and displaying the time remaining.

How to Run:

Save the provided code in a file named QuizApplication.java.
Compile the Java file using the command javac QuizApplication.java.
Run the compiled Java file using the command java QuizApplication.

Thanks to the creators of Java and the developers who contributed to the language and its libraries.

Notes:

The quiz questions and options are hardcoded in the QuizApplication class. You can modify them to add or remove questions.
The timer duration is set to 10 seconds per question. You can modify this value in the QuizApplication class.
The application uses a Scanner to read user input. You can modify the input handling to use a different input method if needed.
The TimerHelper class uses the java.util.Timer class to implement the timer. You can replace it with a different timer implementation if needed.
The TimerHelper class uses a lambda expression to run the task when the timer expires. You can replace it with an anonymous class or a separate class if needed.
